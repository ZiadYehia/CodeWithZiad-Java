# 🚀 CodeWithZiad-Java 🎯


👋 Welcome to CodeWithZiad-Java! This is my Java playground where I practice coding, solve problems, and build small projects.

✨ What you’ll find here:
🟢 Basic Java Syntax (Variables, Loops, Conditionals)
🟡 Functions & OOP Concepts (Classes, Objects, Inheritance)
🔵 Data Structures & Algorithms (Arrays, Lists, Recursion)

🎯 My goal? To level up my Java skills and have fun coding along the way! 🚀💡

📌 Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to explore or drop suggestions! 😊🔥
